                This is was done to work within a small scope of the many audience dormify targeted. Plus, they were more
                easily accessible for our upcoming research.</p>
            <p class="c2">Moving into college can be exciting yet nervous experience especially for students moving far
                away from home. In an informal conversation had by myself and a student, they expressed how important it
                is for their dorm rooms to feel like home, especially after a long day of class.</p>

            <p class="c3">“I’ve never really been the one to care about the look of my room, but ever since moving into
